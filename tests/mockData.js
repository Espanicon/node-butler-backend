However, we don't see community going to any platform and providing reviews or reading other's reviews. There have been some tries already with very limited success. We would like to see a platform that promote P-Reps work instead, no matter who is the team and what they are delivering. That will help community to have a better and fair view on P-Reps work and not a biased one based on the interest of those with higher presence and power. That is what we believe will help to reduce the vote stagnancy and fair distribution of them within the teams adding value to the ICON Network. Sorry guys, not totally convinced on this proposal, but please reformulate to keep delivering analytics or/and a platform that shows P-Rep works and analytics on the impact of them.</p>"

Right now, the ICONist doesn't help us reach our goal of growing the ICON community, it only serves as an outlet for existing ICONists to read about ICON News, which is of course still valuable. I'd like to see them broaden their scope and broaden their audience to help us grow..
